## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Futuristic but Professional** - Exciting without being gimmicky
2. **Performance First** - Animations should enhance, not hinder
3. **Conversion Focused** - Every element serves the waitlist goal
4. **Brand Aligned** - Reflects CoWeave's "Humans + AI" message
5. **Accessible** - Beautiful for everyone

### Animation Guidelines
- ✅ Use animations to guide attention
- ✅ Keep animations under 0.6s
- ✅ Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- ✅ 60fps or don't ship
- ❌ No sudden movements
- ❌ No excessive effects

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Particles not showing?**
- Check tsParticles configuration
- Verify import paths
- Check z-index layering

**Form not submitting?**
- Verify EmailJS credentials
- Check network tab for errors
- Confirm environment variables

**Animations janky?**
- Reduce particle count
- Use `will-change` CSS property
- Check for layout thrashing

**Build errors?**
- Clear node_modules and reinstall
- Check for missing dependencies
- Verify import paths
