## 1. Core Positioning

### Primary Tagline
> **"Production code. Done right."**

### Secondary Tagline
> **"Same quality, every developer, every time."**

### Platform Description
> **"CoWeave is a platform to codify your software development lifecycle with prompts and agentic workflows."**

### Positioning Statement
CoWeave fills the gap between vibe-coding tools (fast prototypes, quick iterations) and production-grade code that is reliable, maintainable, and consistent across teams.

---

## 2. The Variance Cost Problem

### Core Concept
When developers use AI coding tools independently, organizations face a hidden cost:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Different coding styles | Inconsistent codebase |
| Different quality levels | Unpredictable reliability |
| Different test coverage | Gaps in testing |
| Different design patterns | Maintenance complexity |

> **"When five developers use vibe-coding tools, you get five different design patterns, five different approaches, five different quality levels. That's the variance cost—and it compounds with every feature."**

### CoWeave Solution
> "CoWeave eliminates variance - same process, same quality, every time."

---

## 3. The Three Pain Point Questions

Use these to validate the audience's challenges:

### Question 1: PRD/TDD Documentation
> "How many team members actually start from Product Requirement Documents and write Technical Design Documents for the features they're implementing? How many keep these documents in sync with the code as requirements evolve? Or does your team start coding first and handle documentation, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as you go?"

### Question 2: Test-Driven Development
> "Have you ever seen Test-Driven Development actually followed? Tests written FIRST, before the code? Or do tests get rushed in after—with low code coverage, missing the edge cases that cause delays later, or bugs that cause customer dissatisfaction?"

### Question 3: Integration Testing
> "Does your team spend more time in integration testing than anticipated, leading to delays in delivery and lower reliability?"

### Validation Statement
> "If you answered yes to any of these... you've found the gap."

---

## 4. The Gap Framework

### Tool Landscape Positioning

| Tool Type | Best For | Not For |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Vibe-coding tools** | Quick prototypes, fast iterations, code completions | Enforcing SDLC processes to generate reliable software |
| **CoWeave** | Production code, tests, complete SDLC, team consistency | Prototypes, learning, one-offs |

### The Gap Statement
> "Vibe-coding tools are brilliant for speed—when the problem is well-defined, they can write perfect code. But does that code align with your overall product direction? Does it follow your design patterns? That's on you. Will it be reliable? That's on you. Tests? That's on you. Consistency across your team? That's on you."

### Gap Questions
- What tool ensures your SDLC processes are being followed?
- What tool ensures your processes comply with regulations?
- What tool enforces Test-Driven Development?
- What tool generates comprehensive tests alongside your code?
- What tool eliminates the variance cost?
