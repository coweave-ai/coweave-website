| Template Section | Your Customization |
|------------------|-------------------|
| **Stack** | Your actual tech stack |
| **Key Patterns** | Your project's architecture patterns |
| **Local Setup** | Your actual setup commands |

**Example:**

```markdown
## payment-service (customize template)

### Stack
- Node.js + TypeScript + Express
- PostgreSQL + Redis

### Key Patterns

### Local Setup
- `npm install && npm run dev`
```

**15-20 minutes per repository.**

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "teamId": "your-team-id",
    "roleContextId": "senior-developer",
    "repoContextId": "payment-service"
  }'
```

### Step 3: Use in Your AI Tool

Copy the assembled context into Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor as system instructions. Your AI now understands your team's standards.
