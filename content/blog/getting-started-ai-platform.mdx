# Getting Started with CoWeave AI Platform

Your complete guide to SDLC automation. Set up your workflows, connect your context, and go from PRD to production with AI orchestration.

---

## What You're Setting Up

CoWeave AI Platform combines two powerful systems:

| Component | Purpose | Setup Time |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Context Engineering Studio** | Codify your team's standards and practices | 1-2 days |
| **n8n Workflow Engine** | Orchestrate AI agents through your SDLC | 1 day |

**Total setup: ~3 days to your first automated workflow.**

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- [ ] On-prem deployment completed (K8s cluster running)
- [ ] Claude license configured (BYOL - Max or Enterprise)
- [ ] GitHub/GitLab repository connected
- [ ] Admin credentials for n8n and CE Studio

---

## Day 1: Context Engineering Studio Setup

Before automating workflows, you need to codify your team's standards. The AI agents use these contexts to produce consistent, on-brand code.

**Follow our CE Studio guide:** [Getting Started with Context Engineering Studio](/blog/getting-started-ce-studio)

Quick summary of what you'll set up:

| Context Type | What It Contains |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Base Context** | Team-wide coding standards, architecture principles |
| **Role Contexts** | Expertise-level guidance (Senior Dev, QA, etc.) |
| **Repository Contexts** | Project-specific patterns and conventions |
| **Workflow Prompts** | Task-specific instructions for each SDLC phase |

**Why this matters:** Without proper context, AI agents produce generic code. With your context, they produce code that matches your team's standards.

---

## Day 2: n8n Workflow Engine

### Step 1: Sign Into n8n

1. Navigate to your n8n instance URL (provided by your admin)
2. Log in with your credentials
3. You'll see the n8n dashboard with workflow categories

### Step 2: Explore the Workflow Library

CoWeave comes with **45 pre-built workflows** organized by SDLC phase:

| Category | Workflows | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Architecture** | 2 | Design systems, review architecture |
| **Development** | 6 | Implement features, TDD, diagnostics |
| **Code Review** | 2 | AI-driven code review, completeness check |
| **QA & Testing** | 12 | Test execution, infrastructure, deployment |
| **RCA** | 1 | Root cause analysis of failures |
| **Git Integration** | 2 | Setup repos, commit and publish |
| **GitHub** | 7 | Issues, PRs, branches, files |
| **Google Workspace** | 6 | Docs, Sheets, Slides automation |

**To explore:**
1. Click **Workflows** in the left sidebar
2. Browse by folder/category
3. Click any workflow to see its structure

### Step 3: Hello World - Your First Workflow

Let's run a simple workflow to understand how things work.

**Run the Git Setup Workflow:**

1. Find `git-setup-workflow` in the workflow list
2. Click to open it
3. Click **Execute Workflow** (play button)
4. Enter the required parameters:
   - Repository URL
   - Branch name
   - Workspace path
5. Watch the execution progress through each node

**What you'll see:**
- Each node lights up as it executes
- Data flows from node to node
- Final output shows in the last node

**Congratulations!** You just ran your first CoWeave workflow.

---

### Step 4: Understanding Workflow Structure

Every CoWeave workflow follows a pattern:

```
Trigger → Prepare Context → Call AI Agent → Process Output → Next Step
```

**Key node types:**

| Node Type | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Webhook Trigger** | Starts the workflow | GitHub issue created |
| **Code Node** | Prepares data/context | Assemble prompts |
| **HTTP Request** | Calls Claude AI | Send to MCP endpoint |
| **Switch** | Route based on conditions | Success vs. failure path |
| **Set** | Transform data | Format output |

**The AI Call Pattern:**

Every AI workflow contains:
1. **Prepare Message** - Assembles context from CE Studio + runtime data
2. **Call Claude AI** - Sends to `/mcp-workflow` endpoint with role
3. **Process Response** - Extracts artifacts, updates external memory

---

## Day 3: Your First SDLC Automation

Now let's connect everything for real SDLC automation.

### The Full Pipeline

```
GitHub Issue → Architect AI → Developer AI → Code Review → QA → RCA (if needed)
```

### Step 1: Create a Test Issue

1. Go to your connected GitHub repository
2. Create a new issue with a clear requirement
3. Add the label that triggers automation (e.g., `coweave-ready`)

### Step 2: Watch the Magic

The platform automatically:

1. **Downloads the issue** to the workspace
2. **Architect AI** creates Technical Design Document
3. **Developer AI** implements based on TDD
4. **Code Review AI** validates the implementation
5. **QA AI** runs tests
6. **RCA AI** analyzes any failures and guides next iteration

### Step 3: Monitor Progress

**In n8n:**
- Go to **Executions** to see running/completed workflows
- Click any execution to see step-by-step progress
- View input/output data at each node

**In your repository:**
- Check the `work-in-progress/issue-{N}/` directory
- View AI artifacts in `external-memory/iteration-{N}/`
- See generated code in the appropriate branches

---

## Understanding External Memory

CoWeave's unique feature: **Git-based AI memory**.

Every AI decision is persisted:

```
work-in-progress/issue-{N}/
├── documents/              # Human inputs (TDD, PRD, specs)
└── external-memory/
    └── iteration-{N}/
        ├── architecture/   # Architect AI outputs
        ├── dev/           # Developer AI outputs
        ├── dev-review/    # Code review findings
        ├── qa/            # Test results
        └── rca/           # Root cause analysis
```

**Why this matters:**
- Full audit trail of AI decisions
- Agents share context across iterations
- Humans can review and override at any point

## The 11 AI Roles

Your platform includes specialized AI agents:

| Role | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Architect AI** | System design, architecture patterns |
| **Developer AI** | Code implementation |
| **Code Reviewer AI** | Reviews code, identifies gaps |
| **QA AI** | Test execution and validation |
| **RCA AI** | Root cause analysis of failures |
| **Classifier AI** | Issue routing and classification |
| **Documentation AI** | Auto-generates docs |
| **PM AI** | PRD generation |
| **Support AI** | Customer support assistance |
| **Pre-Sales AI** | Technical sales support |
| **Post-Sales AI** | Customer success |

Each role uses your **CE Studio contexts** for consistent outputs.

---

## Connecting CE Studio to Workflows

The power comes from combining them:

### How Context Flows

```
CE Studio                    n8n Workflow
─────────                    ────────────
Base Context ─────┐
                  │
Role Context ─────┼──→ Prompt Assembly ──→ Claude AI ──→ Output
                  │
Repo Context ─────┤
                  │
Workflow Prompt ──┘
```

### Setting Up the Connection

1. In CE Studio, create contexts for each AI role
2. In n8n, workflows automatically fetch assembled context
3. The `Prepare Message` node combines:
   - Your CE Studio context (standards)
   - Runtime data (issue details, file paths)
   - Iteration context (previous results)

---

## Common Workflows to Try

### 1. Architecture Design

**Workflow:** `architect-design-multiple-issues-workflow`

**What it does:**
- Reads requirements from GitHub issues
- Creates comprehensive Technical Design Document
- Generates database schema, API contracts, security design

**Try it:**
1. Create an issue with feature requirements
2. Trigger the architecture workflow
3. Review the TDD in `external-memory/iteration-1/architecture/`

### 2. Development Implementation

**Workflow:** `developer-implement-multiple-issues-workflow`

**What it does:**
- Reads TDD and requirements
- Implements using TDD methodology
- Creates tests first, then implementation
- Commits to Git automatically

### 3. Code Review

**Workflow:** `developer-reviewer-multiple-issues-workflow`

**What it does:**
- Reviews implementation against TDD
- Identifies gaps with severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Creates GAP_ANALYSIS.md for next iteration

### 4. PRD Generation

**Workflow:** `prd-generator-workflow`

**What it does:**
- Takes meeting notes or requirements input
- Generates comprehensive PRD
- Multiple input modes (single source, multi-source, with Claude analysis)

---

## Iteration Loop

CoWeave uses an iterative improvement loop:

```
Iteration 1: Developer → Review → QA → RCA (finds issues)
                                          ↓
Iteration 2: Developer (with RCA guidance) → Review → QA → RCA
                                                            ↓
Iteration N: Continue until QA passes
```

**Each iteration:**
- Reads previous iteration's feedback
- Focuses on remaining gaps
- Updates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md incrementally
- Persists new artifacts
